# Visualizing FordGoBike Data (Jan - Dec 2018)
## by Mohammed Alsenani

## Dataset

> The FordGoBike data is straightforward and intuitive to understand. This data has been collected efficiently, providing a valuable collection of data to work with and draw conclusions from.

The column header descriptions are as follows (each trip is anonymized):

Trip Duration (seconds)
Start Time and Date
End Time and Date
Start Station ID
Start Station Name
Start Station Latitude
Start Station Longitude
End Station ID
End Station Name
End Station Latitude
End Station Longitude
Bike ID
User Type (Subscriber or Customer – “Subscriber” = Member or “Customer” = Casual)
bike_share_for_all_trip

The main features include data related to the start and end of a ride. This can be used to calculate when bikes are in high or low demand. There is also ample data related to the users of the bike service whether they are a paying member or a casual user. These features can be used to make business decisions such as which day of the week bikes should be most available.


## Summary of Findings

>the summer months and early-mid autumn are the most popular times to use the Ford Go Bike sharing system. October is the most popular month, with July as the second most popular, and June/August coming in closely as the third most popular months to use the bike system. The weather in San Francisco is best in the mid-late summer and usually stays sunny until returning to its usual foggy weather in the late autumn/early winter months.

>The bikes saw the most usage during the morning hours of 8-9am, and in the afternoon hours of 5-6pm, which is a typical workday in the United States. This furthers the suggestion that the bikes are being used primarily for commuters

>The catplot and boxplot show the ride duration spread in minutes (note the y-axis isn't shared between the Customer and Subscriber graphs in order to visualize trends easier). Customer typically have trip durations are longer (8 to 18 minutes according to the box plot) than for subscribers (5 to 12 minutes according to the box plot). This can probably be explained by the fact that subscribers are mainly commuters who take short trips to work/school rather than longer trips around the Bay Area

>Customers use the bike sharing system more often on weekends, whilte Subscribers primarily use the bikes on weekdays. Customers: During weekdays, most bike rides occur between 4-6pm, peaking on Fridays around 5pm. During weeknds, most bike rides occur between 11am and 6pm, peaking on Saturdays around 2pm. Subscribers: During weekdays, most bike rides occur around 8-9am and 4-6pm. During weekends, there is a significant drop in the number of rented bikes.


## Key Insights for Presentation

> I focused on my own questions on my mind to answer on presentation as the duration of using the bikes.

The dataset size exceed github limit so I didn't upstream it
